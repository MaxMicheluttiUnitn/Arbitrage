# Arbitrage
Repo for the code produced during my internal internship with Unitn about solving the arbitrage problem through quantum annealing

To use run confronto.py to solve the problem through quantum and classical solvers, run dwave_arb_solver to only solve through the annealer, run classical_arb_solver to only solve through the classical solver.

Run constraints to use the constraint optimizer to find optimal constraints for your problem, to change the method used to search change the function at line 193

To configure, change the values of the global variables at the beginning of each python script
